Introduction to react | virtual dom| part - 2 ;

MVC = model view controller 
it's a backend technology ;

in backend there's a thing called model , view , controller ;

MVC is used there  : where it cotains the same front-end and back-end structure ; which contains back-end and front-end on the same applciation ;

controller is API ; 

But now since back-end and front-end works on different things so we don't have MVC today's we have only MC : model + controller ;

On windows we have both npm and npx 
while on mac and linux there is no use of npx we only use npm 

npx create-react-app my-app		//creat-react-app is an external library which helps us to install react on our pc
now move to that folder then , run yarn start or npm start ;

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
React application is being created by using npx create-react-app my-app

we do all things like css and jsx js in src folder only : 

JSX - Javascript XML

Remember the codes which we see written like html in react files are not html those are JSX 

index.js - starting point of application 
app.js - this is the main file where we add all things ;

App.test.js : it is the file in which with the help of zest library we do checking of developed things whatso we develop its developer role to check at first hand .

zest is inbuilt library for testing ;

In order to run the react app you have to be in that same repo in which react is created ;

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In our react : react uses very advanced javascript and so our browser may happen that they will not understand that advanced level of javascript so : babel what do : babel converts the high level javascripts to browser understandable javascript ; so that the browser can render it easily ;
